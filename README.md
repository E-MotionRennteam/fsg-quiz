# FSG-Quiz App

***

'fsg-quiz' is an app developed by the munichmotorsport software engineering division for the purpose of being able to practice for the event registration quizzes. It was named after FSG because this was the registration quiz it was originally intended and hence first used for; for the same reason, its current specification (pre alpha sumthing) implements *most* of the features of the FSG quiz, namely:

* 30sec timeout after every submit
* shuffling questions and answers after every failed submit
* more than one person at a time can solve a quiz
* it's also visually imitating the dimensions of the original quiz (60% of viewport in use, font sizes etc.)
